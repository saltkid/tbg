# `tbg remove [arg]`
#### args: `path/to/images/dir`
`add` command removes a path to **tbg**'s currently used config. If the `config` subcommand is specified, it will remove the path from that config specified by that subcommand instead.

You can remove flags from a path using `--`flags (see [valid flags](#valid-flags))

# Subcommands
1. `config [arg]`
    - args: `path/to/config.yaml`, `default`
    - instead of using the currently used config, **tbg** will remove the path from the config specified by this subcommand
    - default config is the `config.yaml` that was auto generated by **tbg** on initial execution. It is on the same path as the **tbg** executable

# Valid Flags
1. `--alignment [arg]`
    - args: `topRight`, `top`, `topLeft`, `left`, `center`, `right`, `bottomLeft`, `bottom`, `bottomRight`
    - it will remove the alignment flag of the path specified and replace it with the `default_alignment` value
2. `--stretch [arg]`
    - args: `none`, `fill`, `uniform`, `uniformToFill`
    - it will remove the stretch flag of the path specified and replace it with the `default_stretch` value
3. `--opacity [arg]`
    - args: any float between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
    - it will remove the opacity flag of the path specified and replace it with the `default_opacity` value

**Note**: After replacing the flag with the default value, all flags will be checked one final time to see if all are equal to their default counterparts. If so, **tbg** will just remove the flags of the specified path. If not, **tbg** will keep the updated flags

# Walkthroughs
### Removing a path
Let's say this is the currently used config:
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
If we run:
```
tbg remove path/to/images/dir1
```
It will remove `path/to/images/dir1` from the currently used config's `image_col_paths` field like this:
```
image_col_paths: []

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: fill
default_opacity: 0.1
```
### Removing flags from a path
Let's use this config
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1 | left fill 0.5

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
Let's "remove" the alignment flag of `path/to/images/dir1`:
```
tbg remove path/to/images/dir1 --alignment
```
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1 | _ fill 0.5

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
When you remove a single flag, it will be blanked out. This just means the blanked out alignment flag will inherit the `default_alignment` value (`center`).

Let's remove stretch next.
```
tbg remove path/to/images/dir1 --stretch
```
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1 | _ _ 0.5

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
The stretch flag of `path/to/images/dir1` is blanked out as well. Again, this will inherit the `default_stretch` value: `uniform`.

Now let's see if we remove opacity:
```
tbg remove path/to/images/dir1 --opacity
```
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
It removed the flags of `path/to/images/dir1`. This is because if we removed opacity, all three would've been blank. In this case, **tbg** will just remove the flags of `path/to/images/dir`.

But that seems a lot of prompts just to get rid of all the flags of one path. See next walkthrough for a *"shortcut"*

### Removing all flags from a path
Let's use this config:
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1 | left fill 0.5

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
Instead of removing the flags of `path/to/images/dir1` one by one, we can specify all flags in the prompt
```
tbg remove path/to/images/dir1 -s -a -o
```
Now all 3 flags are specified. This means it will remove all flags of `path/to/images/dir1` like this:
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
That's it. That's the *"shortcut"*

#### Removing a path from specified configs
Let's say the config we have been using in the previous walkthroughs is the default `config.yaml`. Let's remove a path from another config without setting it as the currently used config.
```
# this is another config
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
Now let's remove `path/to/images/dir1` from that config:
```
tbg remove path/to/images/dir1 config path/to/another/config.yaml
```
It will remove `path/to/images/dir1` in `image_col_paths` field of `path/to/another/config.yaml`
```
# this is another config
image_col_paths: []

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
Now if we do this:
```
tbg remove path/to/images/dir1
```
This is the output:
```
# this is the default config
image_col_paths: []

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
There was no error message because it removed `path/to/images/dir1` from the currently used config (in this case, it was the default `config.yaml`), not from `path/to/another/config.yaml` since it was not specified

For more information on setting the currently used config, see [config command usage](https://github.com/saltkid/tbg/blob/main/docs/config_command_usage.md)
