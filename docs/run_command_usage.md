# `tbg run`

`run` command edits the `settings.json` used by *Windows Terminal* using settings from the currently used config. **tbg** will keep running, editing the `settings.json` of *Windows Terminal*, replacing the background image. You can quit by pressing `q` or `ctrl+c`

On initial execution of **tbg**, it will create a `config.yaml` in the same directory as the **tbg** executable if it does not exist already. **There can only be one `config.yaml`**. For more information, see documentation on [config.yaml](https://github.com/saltkid/tbg/blob/main/docs/config.yaml.md).

# Key events
**tbg** takes optional commands during execution:
- `q`: quits
- `c`: shows the available commands
- `n`: goes to next image
- `p`: goes to previous image
- `N`: goes to next image collection
- `P`: goes to previous image collection
- `r`: randomizes the images in the current image collection starting from the current image
    - this does not affect the order of the previous images
- `R`: randomizes the images in the current image collection starting from the current collection
    - this does not affect the order of the previous collections

**tbg** will continue running until you press `q` or `ctrl+c`. This means even if all images are exhausted, **tbg** will safely wrap back around.

For an example, see [walkthrough with key events](#normal-execution)

# Executing with `--`flags
#### Valid Flags: `--profile`, `--interval`, `--alignment`, `--opacity`, `--stretch`, `--random`

`--`flags can be used to override these fields in the config: `profile`, `interval`, `default_alignment`, `default_stretch`, `default_opacity`.

The flags that override default flag fields will override the flags set per path as well. So if there is a `path/to/dir | center fill 0.1`, **tbg** will use the flags instead of that or the default flag fields.

The order of importance is:
1. `--`flags (`--alignment`, `--opacity`, `--stretch`)
2. per path flags
3. default flag fields 

For an example, see [overriding default flags walkthrough](#overriding-default-flag-fields)

#### Using `--random` flag
The `--random` flag will randomize the order of image collections dirs **and** the images. Even if you consumed all dirs and wrap around to the first dir again, the dirs will be re-randomized. Even the images: when you go to next dir B, then go to previous dir A, the order will be different from the first time you go to dir A, since images are also re-randomized every time you enter a dir.

# Walkthroughs
### Normal Execution
This will delve on and key events and path specific flags.

Let's do:
```
tbg run
```
Let's say that this is the config:
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/dir1
- path/to/dir2 | right fill 0.35

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: fill
default_opacity: 0.1
```
This just means that when we do `tbg run`, we want to change the background image of the **default** *Windows Terminal* profile every **30 minutes**. The first few images will be from `path/to/dir1`. The image will be at the **center**, **fill** the entire screen without regard of the original aspect ratio, with an opacity of **10%**. 

When I press `n`, it goes to the next images without waiting for 30 minutes. I can go back by pressing `p`.

When I press `N`, it goes to the next image collection dir. This means we are now in `path/to/dir2`. This path has flags specific to it so these values will be used instead of the default flag fields. This means instead of the image being at the **center**, it will be at the **right**.
- Instead of having an opacity of **10%**, it the images will have **35%** opacity. However, since stretch is the same, it will still **fill** the screen without regard of the orignal aspect ratio.

When I press `P`, it goes back to the previous image collection dir (`path/to/dir1`). If i press `P` again, it will wrap around and go to the last image collection dir (`path/to/dir2`). This wrap around behavior also applies to `N`.

Now let's quit **tbg** by pressing `q` or `ctrl+c`.

### Overriding `profile` and `interval` fields

Instead of `tbg run`, let's do:
```
tbg run --profile list-1 --interval 5
```
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/dir1

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: fill
default_opacity: 0.1
```

The `--profile` and `--interval` flags will override the values in `config-2.yaml`. Again, not edit them. This means instead of changing the background image of the `default` profile every 30 minutes, it will change the background image of the first profile under `list` field in `settings.json`

---
### Overriding default flag fields
This will delve on overriding default flag fields on the config using `--`flags. This will also override the per-path flags

Let's use this config:
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/dir1
- path/to/dir2 | right fill 0.35

profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: fill
default_opacity: 0.1
```
Let's do:
```
tbg run --alignment right --opacity 0.35 --stretch none
```

The `--alignment`, `--opacity`, and `--stretch` flags will override the values in `config.yaml`. This means instead of `path/to/dir`'s images being centered, filling entire screen at 10% opacity, the images will be on the right, with no upscaling/downscaling, at 35% opacity.

Notice that `path/to/dir2` has flags that should override the default flag fields. However, since we specified `--alignment right --opacity 0.35 --stretch none`, we'll use these value instead, like what we did with `path/to/dir1`.
