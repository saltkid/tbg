# `tbg add [arg]`
#### args: `path/to/images/dir`
`add` command adds a path to **tbg**'s currently used config. If the `config` subcommand is specified, it will add the path to that config specified by that subcommand instead.

You can add flags to a path to be added using `--`flags (see [valid flags](#valid-flags))

# Subcommands
1. `config [arg]`
    - args: `path/to/config.yaml`, `default`
    - instead of using the currently used config, **tbg** will add the path to the config specified by this subcommand
    - default config is the `config.yaml` that was auto generated by **tbg** on initial execution. It is on the same path as the **tbg** executable

# Valid Flags
1. `--alignment [arg]`
    - args: `topRight`, `top`, `topLeft`, `left`, `center`, `right`, `bottomLeft`, `bottom`, `bottomRight`
    - it will add flags to the path being added after a pipe `|`
        - example: `path/to/images/dir | center fill 0.5`
2. `--stretch [arg]`
    - args: `none`, `fill`, `uniform`, `uniformToFill`
    - it will add flags to the path being added after a pipe `|`
3. `--opacity [arg]`
    - args: any float between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
    - it will add flags to the path being added after a pipe `|`

# Walkthroughs
### Adding a path
Let's say this is the currently used config:
```
image_col_paths: []

other fields...
```
If we run:
```
tbg add path/to/images/dir1
```
It will add `path/to/images/dir1` to the currently used config's `image_col_paths` field like this:
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1

other fields...
```
### Adding a path with flags
Let's continue with our config and run this:
```
tbg add path/to/images/dir2 --alignment left --stretch uniform --opacity 0.5
```
It will add `path/to/images/dir2` in `image_col_paths` field and add flags to it like this:
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1
- path/to/images/dir2 | left uniform 0.5

other fields...
```
Let's add another one:
```
tbg add path/to/images/dir3 --alignment center
```
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1
- path/to/images/dir2 | left uniform 0.5
- path/to/images/dir3 | center _ _

other fields...
```
Since only `--alignment` was specified, the other two flags are blanked out. This just means the blanked out flags will inherit their respective default flag field value (`default_stretch` and `default_opacity` in this example)

#### Adding a flag to an existing path
Let's continue with our config and run this:
```
tbg add /path/to/images/dir3 --stretch fill
```
This will find if `path/to/images/dir3` is already in `image_col_paths` field and add a stretch flag `fill` to it.
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1
- path/to/images/dir2 | left uniform 0.5
- path/to/images/dir3 | center fill _

other fields...
```
Let's fill assign the opacity too
```
tbg add /path/to/images/dir3 --opacity 0.5
```
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1
- path/to/images/dir2 | left uniform 0.5
- path/to/images/dir3 | center fill 0.5

other fields...
```
#### Changing a flag of an existing path
Let's continue with our config:
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1
- path/to/images/dir2 | left uniform 0.5
- path/to/images/dir3 | center fill 0.5

other fields...
```
Let's change the opacity and stretch:
```
tbg add /path/to/images/dir3 --opacity 1 --stretch none
```
This will find if `path/to/images/dir3` is already in `image_col_paths` field and set the opacity to `1` and the stretch to `none`.
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1
- path/to/images/dir2 | left uniform 0.5
- path/to/images/dir3 | center none 1

other fieds...
```
Let's change the alignment too
```
tbg add /path/to/images/dir3 --alignment bottom
```
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1
- path/to/images/dir2 | left uniform 0.5
- path/to/images/dir3 | bottom center none 1

other fields...
```

### Adding a path to specified configs
Let's say the config we have been using in the previous walkthroughs is the default `config.yaml`. Let's add a path to another config without setting it as the currently used config.
```
# this is another config
image_col_paths: []

profile: list-1
interval: 5

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: none
default_opacity: 1
```
Now let's add a path to that config:
```
tbg add path/to/images/dir1 config path/to/another/config.yaml
```
It will add `path/to/images/dir1` in `image_col_paths` field and add flags to it like this:
```
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1

profile: list-1
interval: 5

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: none
default_opacity: 1
```
Now if we do this:
```
tbg add path/to/images/dir2
```
This is the output:
```
path/to/images/dir2 is already in config path/to/default/config.yaml
```
It will not add `path/to/images/dir2` because this already exists, not in `path/to/another/config.yaml`, but in the default `config.yaml` (which is our currently used config in this example`.
```
# this is the default config
image_col_paths:
- path/to/images/dir1
- path/to/images/dir2 | left uniform 0.5
- path/to/images/dir3 | bottom center none 1


profile: default
interval: 30

default_alignment: center
default_stretch: uniform
default_opacity: 0.1
```
